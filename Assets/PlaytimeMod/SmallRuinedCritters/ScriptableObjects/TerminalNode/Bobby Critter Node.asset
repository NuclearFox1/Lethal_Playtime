  displayText: 'The Ruined Smiling Critters resemble decayed and destroyed Smiling
    Critters toys, with many missing their button eyes, exposing beneath bright white
    irises with pupils, perhaps their true eyes.


    The Ruined Smiling Critters
    are bloodthirsty monsters with no hint of remorse. Their sadistic tendencies
    likely stem from the fact they are incredibly inhumane, creepily giggling and
    screeching animalistically while stalking their prey. They seem to only be this
    way because of CatNap''s orders, who threatens to starve or even kill them if
    they disobey him.'
