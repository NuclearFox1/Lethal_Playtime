  displayText: 'Miss Delight has shimmering golden hair with a crimson bow tie perched
    atop of her head. She wears a torn crimson skirt adorned with playful polka dots
    and a vibrant tri-color shirt of blue, red, and yellow with an apple symbol on
    it. A crimson tie can be seen accentuating her office shirt. Her once smiling
    grin is now completely broken, exposing the now dirty flesh and teeth underneath.
    Part of her shirt is torn and dirty, which likely occurred during The Hour of
    Joy.

    

    Her shoes are encased in a pair of crimson hues, and have intricate
    blue embroidery on them. Her body is made up of several segments on different
    joints, resembling that of a ball-jointed doll.

    

    She wields a make-shift
    morning star called "Barb." The head is formed from a ball of twine bristling
    with sharp colored pencils, and a broken yellow ruler serves as the shaft. Both
    the head and the sharp end of the handle are covered in dried blood.
